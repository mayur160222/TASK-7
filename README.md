# TASK-7
– My Browser Extension Security Check
As part of the cybersecurity internship, I completed Task 7, which asked me to check my browser extensions and remove any that looked suspicious. I wanted to see if anything I had installed could pose a security risk or was unnecessary.

Step 1: What Extensions I Had Installed
When I opened my browser’s extension manager, I found these four:

AdBlocker

McAfee WebAdvisor

Recall

Cookie Editor

Step 2: Reviewing Each One
AdBlocker
Purpose: Blocks annoying ads and trackers.

Permissions: Can read and change data on websites (which is normal for ad blockers).

Risk: Minimal if it’s a trusted version (like Adblock Plus or uBlock Origin).

Decision: Kept – It’s useful and well-known.

McAfee WebAdvisor
Purpose: Warns me about risky websites.

Permissions: Can access all website data to check links and downloads.

Risk: Moderate — it’s from a trusted brand, but heavy on system resources.

Decision: Kept, but I’ll monitor performance.

Recall
Purpose: Unknown to me before this review.

Permissions: Could read all data on all sites – that’s concerning.

Research: Couldn’t find solid info on the developer or reviews. Looked sketchy.

Decision: Removed – Too risky and I don’t even remember installing it.

Cookie Editor
Purpose: Lets me manually view and edit browser cookies.

Permissions: Full access to cookies (expected).

Usefulness: Good for debugging or testing, but not needed daily.

Decision: Kept, but disabled it when not in use to reduce attack surface.

Step 3: Clean-Up & Results
I removed "Recall" because it felt unnecessary and suspicious.

I disabled Cookie Editor when not actively using it.

After restarting the browser, things ran a little smoother and I felt more confident about my setup.

--What I Learned
Some extensions ask for more access than they need.

Just because an extension is installed doesn’t mean it’s safe.

It’s easy to forget what we installed — regular checks are a good habit.

Always verify an extension’s developer, reviews, and permissions.
